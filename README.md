# Workshop: Customizing Your Stylesheets

So you’ve heard of Sass. In fact, you're probably using it. You write variables and use predefined mixins like a pro. But are you using Sass to its full potential?

This workshop will explore advanced Sass functionality. We’ll talk about the fundamental differences in lists, maps, extends, and mixins, and will dive deep into writing custom mixins. We’ll discuss partials and how to further DRY out our Sass by leveraging available functions, then writing our own custom functions, documenting the process, and architecting a fluid system.

### Pre-requisites:

  1. Before getting started, please make sure to have [node](https://nodejs.org/download/) installed onto your system. [This](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#osx) is a great set of instructions for installing node with a package manager. I would highly recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to install node on a Mac.
  2. Optionally, for scss linting within the terminal, have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed.
  3. Download [this](https://github.com/una/gulp-starter-env) starter environment.
